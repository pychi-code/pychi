# pychi

A Python package for simulating the propagation of optical pulses in nonlinear materials.

## Capabilities

*pychi* is aimed at simulating the propagation of short pulses in nonlinear media and capturing as much physics as possible. It is based on a unidirectional propagation model, which stays valid even for sub-cycle optical pulses. In particular, this propagation model accounts for
- Full frequency dependence of the effective refractive index
- Quadratic nonlinear interactions (sum- and difference-frequency generation)
- Cubic nonlinear interactions (triple sum-frequency generation, self-phase modulation, conjugated Kerr term)
- Raman scattering
- Self-steepening
- Frequency-dependence of the nonlinear coefficients and effective area
- z-dependence of the effective refractive index, nonlinear coefficients and effective area (permitting poling to be simulated)

The package is built to be as user-friendly as possible, providing a relatively high-level interface for the user while still allowing for physically intricate simulation cases. It leverages a custom-made order 5 solver, although more classical solvers (such as the RK4IP) have also been implemented for completeness and versatility.

## Installation

First, make sure pip is up-to-date using
```
pip install --upgrade pip
```

On Windows, install the package using
```
pip install pychi
```

On Mac, one might have to first run
```
conda install -c conda-forge pyfftw
```
due to some OS specificities in pyFFTW installation.

Then, one should be able to install pychi normally using
```
pip install pychi
```


## Documentation

This documentation has been automatically generated using SPHINX, and is still a work in progress. Do not hesitate to contact us for any needed clarifications and examples.

## Example

Here is a typical example of the use of pychi to simulate the propagation of a short optical pulse in a nonlinear waveguide exhibiting both cubic and quadratic nonlinearities.

```python

Created on Mon Feb 28 15:31:47 2022
The waveguide/fiber parameters are first provided, and a Waveguide instance
is created. Then, the pulse parameters are used to create a Light object.
A physical model is then chosen, taking into account different nonlinear
interactions based on the user choice. Finally, a solver is instantiated
and computes the propagation of the pulse in the waveguide with the chosen
nonlinear interactions.

### Simulation
t_pts = 2**15

### Light
pulse_duration = 100e-15
pulse_wavelength = 1.56e-06
pulse_energy = 1e-9

### Waveguide
wg_length = 0.001
wg_chi_2 = 1.1e-12
wg_chi_3 = 3.4e-21

### Prepare waveguide
waveguide = pychi.materials.Waveguide(wg_freq, wg_n_eff, wg_chi_2, wg_chi_3,
                                wg_a_eff, wg_length, t_pts=t_pts)
# Additional options:
# wg_n_eff can be a 2 dimensional array, with first dimension the wavelength dependence
# and second dimension the z dependence.
#
# chi2 and chi3 can be callables, returning a z dependent value. Alternatively, they
# can be defined as one dimensional arrays describing their z dependence, or
# two dimensional arrays describing their z and frequency dependence. They
# can also be callables of (z, freq).
#
# One can use waveguide.set_gamma(gamma) or waveguide.set_n2(n2) to provide a
# nonlinear coefficient or nonlinear refractive index and overwrite chi3.
#
# Check documentation for more options and details.


### Prepare input pulse
pulse = pychi.light.Sech(waveguide, pulse_duration, pulse_energy, pulse_wavelength)
# Other available pulse shapes:
# pulse = pychi.light.Gaussian(waveguide, pulse_duration, pulse_energy, pulse_wavelength)
# pulse = pychi.light.Cw(waveguide, pulse_average_power, pulse_wavelength)
# pulse = pychi.light.Arbitrary(waveguide, pulse_frequency_axis, pulse_electric_field, pulse_energy)


### Prepare model
model = pychi.models.SpmChi2Chi3(waveguide, pulse)
# Other models available:
# model = pychi.models.Spm(waveguide, pulse)
# model = pychi.models.Chi2(waveguide, pulse)
# model = pychi.models.Chi3(waveguide, pulse)
# model = pychi.models.SpmChi2(waveguide, pulse)
# model = pychi.models.SpmChi3(waveguide, pulse)
# model = pychi.models.Chi2Chi3(waveguide, pulse)


### Prepare solver, solve
solver = pychi.solvers.Solver(model)
solver.solve()


"""
Plots
"""
pulse.plot_propagation()
# Results can also be accessed via pulse.z_save, pulse.freq, pulse.spectrum, pulse.waveform
# The refractive index and GVD can be seen with waveguide.plot_refractive_index()
